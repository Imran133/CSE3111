#Join Pattern
Join-patterns provides a way to write concurrent, 
parallel and distributed computer programs. 
It works by sending message.
Concurrent programming is the way in which we can 
perform multiple computations at a time it is opposite to the 
sequentially . Concurrent computations is the process in which we
need not to wait for the other computations.
Following the concurrent method ,join pattern also provide parallel 
algorithm in which multiple task of an algorithm is performed at the same
time at the end all the tasks are combined together to get the
correct output.
On the other hand the distributed method is also a feature of join pattern
where Distributed computing is a field of computer science that studies distributed systems. 
A distributed system is a model in which components located on networked computers communicate 
and coordinate their actions by passing messages.
The join pattern method works by using the thread and locks.
it is a high level programming model . This model also use the communication constructs model 
to abstract the complexity of concurrent environment.
This template is based on join-calculus and use pattern matching.
where the join-calculus is a process calculus developed at INRIA.
The join-calculus was developed to provide a formal basis for the design 
of distributed programming languages. It is very much like a pipeline which
works by synchronization and mathching .This concept is summarize by matching and joining a 
set of message available from different message queues.
 then it handles them all simultaneously with one handle.
 
The Concurrent Basic offer the join patterns it is and example of Visual Basic with asynchronous concurrency.
The Concurrent Basic class can declare method to execute when communication has occurred .


##Why join pattern are used 
    Database can be exits in multiple source, when dividing the entire value in many source then 
it is important to merge them at a particular point . join patterns are used to perform this operation.



##Practical Example
    In case of stack Overflow joining the data from the comment and the user id is done 
by following the join pattern
    

##Types of join pattern

  **Inner join**

  **Outer Join**

- Left outer join
  
-  Right outer join

- Full outer join

**Anti join**

  **Cartesian product**

##FORM OF A Join-patterns:
   
            j.When(A).And(B) then Do(D).
   where A, B are the arguments , when A and B Synchronize the it perform the
   operation in D.
   
It means that  when a message matches with a serise of linked patterns then the handler to run.
or it waits until a message occurs and it cause one of the pattern to occur.
In case more than one matches one unspecified pattern is selected.

##USE of join pattern:

  Join pattern is used in different languages among then many languages use  the join pattern as their basis way of implementation. Many language use the 
   join pattern as a scheme.

 **  Languages that use the Join pattern:**

                         Python , c#.

##Example:

    class ordered JoinPattern {
    void A() & B() {
    }
    void A() & C() {
    }
    void A() & D() {
    }
    signal D() & E() {
    }
 }

 The above example is the example of multiple join pattern.
 In the above example the fragment is called after calling
 A(), B(), C() and D().


  class A {
    
    int f()&g(int a) {
       return a;
                     }
          }
		  
The above example is the example of java join .
the java join is a programming language which is based on the java programming language.
which use the join calculas.



##Steps of a join pattern:

1.Making a chord

2.Receive data from a channel

3.Is there any channel connected to the chord

4.Wait to receive data from another channel

5.Are those data free for chord

6.Execute the operation of the chord

First of all the join pattern system make a chord then it receive data from the channel, if there is any channel connected to the chord then it execute the operation of that chord. but if not then it checks if those data free of chord , if yes it execute the operation of that chord otherwise it perform operation from the very beginning.
